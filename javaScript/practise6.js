console.log("Dynamic vs Static Typing ?")
// javaScript is dynamically typed language 
// dynamically typed language allows us to not have to say what type of variable this variable  var a = 100
//  statically typed language  I have to say what kind this variable is going to be eg C++ int a; a= 100;
// In statically typed language get less bugs in production 
// In static types usually prevent bugs nd help keep errors from happening dynamic typing allows
// u to be more flexible nd write software faster typescript allows us to make JS to behave like statically 
// typed language its add types to JS so it makes JS extra safe 
// In dynamically typed languages type checking is done during runtime 

console.log("Weakly nd strongly typed ?")
// dynamic languages weekly typed in static language is strongly typed 
// which simply is not the case 
// weak language that is statically type nd strong language that is dynamically typed 
// weak type language example 
// var a = "booooyaa"
// a+17
// example python is strongly typed langua 
// var = "boooyaaa"
// a+17
// it show throw refrence Error because u can't add string nd number directly

console.log("static Typing in JS ?")
// there are tools like Flow, ELM ( created by FB ), reason  AML , TS
//they all try nd make JS a statically typed language 
//flow ---> babel ---> JavaScript
// flow which is used very commonly with react projects is what we call a static type checker 
//type Script has own compiler TS
//Angular is bulit with Type Script and using typescript 
// typeScript is superSet of JS 
// Static typing which adds an extra layer of security or an extra layer of type safety in the code
