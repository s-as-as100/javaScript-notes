 console.log("Scope chain nd lexical environment !")
 // Scope means  where u can  Access the specific var nd function 
 // in pur code 
 //(1) what is the scope of variable B ;
 //(2) is Being b inside the scope 

//  function a() {
//     var b = 19;
//      c();
//       function c() {
          
//  }
// }
// a();
// console.log(b)
// b is not defined 

// whenver execution context is created lexical environment is also created 
// lex env along with local memory nd lex en form its parents (lexical parents)
// c function is lexcial inside the a () function 
// nd a lexical inside the global scope 
// func c is physical present inside the code !
 
// first we invoke the function a() 
// global execution context is created inside the call slack
// whenevr a new funtion invoke there is new execution context is created 
// inside the exection context two phse memory nd code phase
// inside the local memory  a  lexcial env is created (orange)  block
// this refer to parent of lexical env nd global ex cont is also have 
//lex evn which is refer to null block 


// scope chains is nothing is chain of lexical environment
