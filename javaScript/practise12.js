// was anything that was private that shouldn't be accessed from 
// say class or even object we should add _ to let others programmers know
// _attack() { underscore represent private method u should not call}
// well other language like java actually have keywords like private
// that makes things private for us eg private attack()

console.log(" 4 pillars of OOPS ?")

//1. Encapsulation 
// we wrap code into boxes that are related to one another so that these 
// boxes can just interact with each others using the methods nd properties that we make available 
// this make code easier to maintain nd more resusable right

//2  Abstraction means just hiding the complexity from the users that is creating simpler 
// interfaces such 
// idea of abstraction also helps when we have priavte variables nd private methods 


//3 inheritance 
// we avoid having to rewrite the same code nd we also save memory
// space by having shared methods 



//4 Polymorphism 
// but the idea is the abiltiy to call the same method on different objects nd each object responding in 
// different way 


// we also learn how memory efficient it is especially in jS 
 // where objects use refrences instead  of cloning nd copying
 // each other nd finally we're able to make our code dry
